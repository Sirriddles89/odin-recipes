    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Beets can be a divisive thing; some people enjoy the intensely earthy flavors and others... do not. That said, the barrier
        to entry for many people is simply knowing how to cook them properly. Raw beets are very hard, and often people resort to 
        simply boiling them in water. We can do better.
