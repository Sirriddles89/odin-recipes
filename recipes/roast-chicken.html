    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Learning how to properly roast a chicken at home is the key to a variety of delicious and cost-effective meals. 
        A technique called <i>spatchcocking</i> will ensure that the bird cooks evenly, and a simple dry-brine of salt 
        and sugar is all that is needed to inject flavor.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole raw chicken; 3-5lbs</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise (Duke's or Hellman's)</li>
        <li>Dijon Mustard</li>
        <li>Roasting Herbs (Thyme, Rosemary, Sage</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt & Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Using kitchen shears, cut the spine out of the back of the bird. Flip over and gently press to crack the breastplate.</li>
        <li>Place the bird skin-side down on a sheet with a wire rack. Season generously with salt, sparingly with sugar, then set aside for at least 4 hours (up to 24)</li>
        <li>Stir together 1/2 cup of mayo with 1 tbsp of dijon mustard.</li>
        <li>Once time has passed, wash off bird and pat dry with a towel. Place back on sheet with wire rack, skin-side up this time. Rub bird with mayo/dijon mixture, making sure to 
            cover entirely. Season with more salt and pepper, and add roasting herbs to tray. </li>
        <li>Roast bird in oven at 450 degrees, until it reaches an internal temp of 155-165f. Let cool 20 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
