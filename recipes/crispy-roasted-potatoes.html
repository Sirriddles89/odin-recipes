    <h1>Crispy Roasted Potatoes</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Achieving crispy potatoes without a deep fryer is always a challenge, but there are techniques that can help us get there. 
        Par-boiling cut potatoes in alkaline water (i.e water with baking soda) helps break down the outside of the potato chunk, which 
        makes it easier for an oven to crisp.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds of russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Baking Soda</li>
        <li>Bacon Fat (or simple cooking oil)</li>
        <li>Dry Spices (Garlic, onion, paprika, cayenne)</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Peel russets and cut them into 1-inch chunks. Bring water to a boil first, then add potatoes.</li>
        <li>Add 1tsp of baking soda and 2 Tbsp of salt to the pot and bring back to a boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook potatoes until they are soft.</li>
        <li>Strain potatoes of all water, then place in a mixing bowl. Toss with bacon fat, dry spices, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread potatoes evenly on a baking sheet with foil. Bake at 450 degrees until golden brown and crispy.</li>
    </ol>
